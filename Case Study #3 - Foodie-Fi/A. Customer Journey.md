## :avocado: Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi - Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

I have selected three customers to focus on and will now share their onboarding journey.

***
#### Customer 1:
```sql
select s.customer_id,p.plan_name,s.start_date
from subscriptions s
join plans p on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where s.customer_id = 1;
```
#### Output :
| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | trial         | 2020-08-01 |
