# üçï Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## Solution - B. Runner and Customer Experience


### 1.How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
```sql
select DATEPART(week,registration_date) as registration_week,count(*) as number_of_registration
from runners
group by DATEPART(week,registration_date);
```
| registration_week | number_of_registration |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1                 | 1                      |
| 2                 | 2                      |
| 3                 | 1                      |

### 2.What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
```sql
select r.runner_id,round(avg(cast(DATEDIFF(minute,c.order_time,r.pickup_time)as float)),2) as avg_pickup_time
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
group by r.runner_id;
```
| runner_id | avg_pickup_time |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1         | 15.67           |
| 2         | 24.2            |
| 3         | 10              |

### 3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
```sql
with prepare as (
	select c.order_id,count(c.order_id) as pizza_order,c.order_time,r.pickup_time,
		cast(DATEDIFF(minute,c.order_time,r.pickup_time) as float) as prep_time
	from customer_orders c
	join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
	where r.cancellation is null
	group by c.order_id,c.order_time,r.pickup_time
)
select pizza_order , concat(avg(cast(prep_time as float)),' min') as avg_prep_time
from prepare
group by pizza_order;
```
| pizza_order | avg_prep_time |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 12.2 min      |
| 2           | 18.5 min      |
| 3           | 30 min        |

### 4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
```sql
select c.customer_id, concat(round(AVG(cast(r.distance as float)),2),' KM') as avg_distance
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
group by c.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | avg_distance |
|-------------|--------------|
| 101         | 20 KM        |
| 102         | 16.73 KM     |
| 103         | 23.4 KM      |
| 104         | 10 KM        |
| 105         | 25 KM        |
---
### 5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
```sql
select min(r.duration) as shortest_delivery,
		max(r.duration) as longest_delivery,
		max(r.duration)-min(r.duration) as difference_in_delivery
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id;
```
| shortest_delivery | longest_delivery | difference_in_delivery |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 10                | 40               | 30                     |
---
### 6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
```sql
select runner_id,order_id,round((cast(distance as float)/cast(duration as float))*60,2) as avg_speed,
		round(round((cast(distance as float)/cast(duration as float))*60,2)-(lag(round((cast(distance as float)/cast(duration as float))*60,2),1) over(partition by runner_id order by runner_id)),2) as trend_in_speed
from runner_orders
where cancellation is null
order by runner_id,order_id;
```
| runner_id | order_id | avg_speed | trend_in_speed |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| 1         | 1        | 37.5      | NULL           |
| 1         | 2        | 44.44     | 6.94           |
| 1         | 3        | 40.2      | -4.24          |
| 1         | 10       | 60        | 19.8           |
| 2         | 4        | 35.1      | -58.5          |
| 2         | 7        | 60        | NULL           |
| 2         | 8        | 93.6      | 33.6           |
| 3         | 5        | 40        | NULL           |
---
### 7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
```sql
select runner_id, count(pickup_time) as delivered_orders,
		count(*) as total_orders,
		concat(cast(count(pickup_time) as float)/cast(count(*) as float)*100,'%') as successful_delivery 
from runner_orders
group by runner_id;
```
| runner_id | delivered_orders | total_orders | successful_delivery |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1         | 4                | 4            | 100%                |
| 2         | 3                | 4            | 75%                 |
| 3         | 1                | 2            | 50%                 |
