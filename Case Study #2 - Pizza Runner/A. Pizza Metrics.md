select count(*) as total_pizzas_ordered 
from customer_orders;
```
|total_pizzas_ordered|
|--------------------|
|14|
### 2.How many unique customer orders were made?
```sql
select COUNT( distinct order_id) as unique_orders 
from customer_orders;
```
|unique_orders|
|-------------|
|10|
### 3.How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
```sql
select runner_id, count(*) as orders_delivered
from runner_orders
where cancellation is null 
group by runner_id;
```
| runner_id | orders_delivered |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 4                |
| 2         | 3                |
| 3         | 1                |
### 4.How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
```sql
select p.pizza_name, count(c.order_id) as pizzas_delivered
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id
join pizza_names p on c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
where r.cancellation is null
group by p.pizza_name;
```
| pizza_name | pizzas_delivered |
|------------|------------------|
| Meatlovers | 9                |
| Vegetarian | 3                |
### 5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

	sum(case
		when (exclusions is null and extras is null) then 1 else 0
	end) as no_change_in_pizza
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id=r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
group by c.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```
| customer_id | change_in_pizza | no_change_in_pizza |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 101         | 0               | 2                  |
