from runner_orders
where cancellation is null

select p.pizza_name, count(c.order_id) as pizzas_delivered
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id = r.order_id

group by p.pizza_name;
```
### 5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

order by pizza_count desc;
```
### 7.For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

		when (exclusions is null and extras is null) then 1 else 0
	end) as no_change_in_pizza
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id=r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null
group by c.customer_id
order by c.customer_id;
```
### 8.How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

select count(*) as pizza_count_w_exclusions_extras
from customer_orders c
join runner_orders r on c.order_id=r.order_id
where r.cancellation is null and c.exclusions is not null and extras is not null;
```
### 9.What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
